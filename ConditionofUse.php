<strong>Information on Our Site</strong>
<br /><br />
We try to be as accurate as possible. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other Daybreak Electronics Property content is accurate, complete, 
reliable, current, or error-free. Prices and promotions are subject to change, and may vary from those offered in our stores. We cannot confirm the 
availability or price of an item until you place your order. Despite our best efforts, rarely an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer 
may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order or we may contact you for instructions on the order.
<br /><br />
<strong>Paying for Your Order</strong>
<br /><br />
Generally, we'll charge your card for an item when we ship the item to you or confirm its availability in store. However, we may preauthorize your order amount 
with your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When you preorder with a debit card, 
we'll debit your card when you place the preorder. For special delivery items, we'll charge your card when you confirm a delivery time. For digital items, we'll 
charge your card when you initiate the download of the product or the product is placed in your account and available for use.
<br /><br />
<Strong>Order Confirmation</strong>
<br /><br />
Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your 
order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or 
any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or 
part of an order that we've already charged you for, we'll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.

<br /><br />
<strong>Disputes</strong><br /><br />

Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of any Daybreak Electronics Property, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Daybreak Electronics or through 
any Daybreak Electronics Property will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The 
Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Conditions of Use.
<br /><br />
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION OR 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY. ALTHOUGH REVIEW IS LIMITED, AN ARBITRATOR
CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT, AND MUST ENFORCE THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED IN THESE CONDITIONS OF USE AS A 
COURT WOULD.
<br /><br />
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a demand to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) describing your claim and serve a copy of the demand on our 
registered agent CT Corporation System, Inc., 100 South Fifth Street, Suite 1075, Minneapolis, MN 55402. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules,
including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules and the form for filing an arbitration claim are available at www.adr.org or
by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees
(but not any attorney's fees) for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous. Likewise, Daybreak Electronics will not seek attorneys'
fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location.
<br /><br />
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings of any nature or in any forum will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or 
representative action. This means that you may not purport to act on behalf of a class or any other person. Likewise, an arbitrator may consolidate more than one 
person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
<br /><br />
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable. This means that any
claim would be decided by a judge, not a jury.
<br /><br />
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to seek to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
<br /><br />
<strong>Applicable Law</strong><br /><br />

The Federal Arbitration Act and applicable federal law (or in the absence of applicable federal law, then the laws of the state of Minnesota), without regard to principles
of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and apply to any disputes or claims against Daybreak Electronics arising out of or relating in any way to your use of any
Daybreak Electronics Property or to any products or services sold or distributed by Daybreak Electronics or through any Daybreak Electronics Property.
<br /><br />
<strong>Termination of Use</strong><br /><br />

We may, in our sole discretion, terminate your account or your use of the Daybreak Electronics Properties at any time. You are personally liable for any orders that you place or charges
that you incur prior to termination. We may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspects of any Daybreak Electronics Property at any time without prior notice.
